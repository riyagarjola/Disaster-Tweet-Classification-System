Here I build a machine learning model that can classify whether a tweet is about a real disaster or not. This helps emergency services and news outlets prioritize genuine disaster reports on social media.
# üå™ Disaster Tweet Classification System

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to classify whether a tweet is about a *real disaster* or not. It is inspired by a real-world problem where emergency response teams need to prioritize authentic disaster-related information from social media.

## üìñ Project Overview

Social media platforms like Twitter are flooded with information, especially during natural disasters. But not all of them are true or useful. This project aims to:
- Detect if a tweet is about a real disaster or not.
- Help emergency services by filtering relevant information.
- Demonstrate end-to-end NLP pipeline ‚Äî preprocessing, EDA, training, evaluation, and deployment.
